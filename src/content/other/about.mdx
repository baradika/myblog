Hi there! My name is Fase Rais Baradika, but most people know me as b4r. I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity, with a strong focus on Digital Forensics, Cryptography, and Reverse Engineering. One of my favorite ways to learn and challenge myself is by participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

I'm currently a student at SMKN 24 Jakarta, where I actively pursue my interests in both cybersecurity and problem-solving. In addition to that, Iâ€™m also passionate about Backend Development, particularly using Golang and Python. This aligns perfectly with my current focus on backend systems as part of my vocational studies. I also enjoy building user-friendly and visually appealing web applications, combining strong backend logic with clean, efficient frontend experiences.

On this blog, I share my journey through writeups, personal insights, and practical tips on cybersecurity, along with highlights from my web development projects. I strongly believe in learning by doing, and both CTFs and web development have been incredible spaces for growth, experimentation, and collaboration.

In addition to sharing my experiences, I also offer services including:

* Designing and creating CTF challenges across multiple categories such as Web, Cryptography, Forensics, and Reverse Engineering

* Setting up complete CTF infrastructure including deployment, scoreboard, hosting, and monitoring

* Building custom websites with robust backend architecture and clean, efficient frontend design

If you are interested in working together, feel free to get in touch to discuss your project in detail.

Hi there! My name is Fase Rais Baradika, but most people know me as **b4r**. I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity, with a strong focus on Digital Forensics, Cryptography, and Reverse Engineering. One of my favorite ways to learn and challenge myself is by participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

I'm currently a student at **SMKN 24 Jakarta**, where I actively pursue my interests in both cybersecurity and problem-solving. In addition to that, I’m also passionate about Backend Development, particularly using Golang and Python. This aligns perfectly with my current focus on backend systems as part of my vocational studies. I also enjoy building user-friendly and visually appealing web applications, combining strong backend logic with clean, efficient frontend experiences.

On this blog, I share my journey through writeups, personal insights, and practical tips on cybersecurity, along with highlights from my web development projects. I strongly believe in learning by doing, and both CTFs and web development have been incredible spaces for growth, experimentation, and collaboration.
